# Serkan Onal Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio project was created in order to provide people/ employers the ability to find out more information about myself and the work/ projects i have either created or collaborated on. I have attempted to demonstrated my abilities by creating this website which has clear/ concise layout, provides friendly user experience with navigatable links to specific sections of the website.

The website presents my projects and allows users the ability to view the source code/ repositories when they are click on.

The website also encorporates a responsive design to allow users the ability to view it on different device screens.

 Some considerations which i had to encoporate into my website beforehand and during the development. 

- ***Clean and consistant layout*** - To provide a clean website layout, which enables users to navigate the website and find relevant information.
- ***Navigation*** - Provide clear links to sections of the website with the use of a navigation bar.
- ***Present Projects/ Work*** - Provide a section of the website which will allow people the ability to view work which i have created or collaborated on. All bodies of work will allow users to view source code or repositories when click on.
- ***Responsive Design*** - Provide a website which is responsive, and can adjust/ adapt itself to different screen size.
- ***Interactive Design*** - Provide users with some interactive elements so they are able to have better user experience.
- ***Code Optimisation*** - Reduce the amount of repeated code within the website to make the website load faster and easier to understand for other developers.
